[http://inaustin.surge.sh](http://inaustin.surge.sh)

### Project Summary
This project is a "GeoGuesser" game that produces a random street view image in the Austin area and prompts the user to guess the location on an adjacent map of Austin (analogous to the popular https://geoguessr.com/). After the guess is made the the distance is measured between the guessed location and the actual location of the street view panorama. This project relies heavily on the google maps API for visualization of coordinates given as well as producing map distance between guesses and actual locations of panoramas.
